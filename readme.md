You can use any lang languages for microservices, but we recommend to use **GoLang** as main language.
It simple for use and study language and have small footprint (memory usage, app size, easy use concurrency)

### Main programming languages

- **Golang** - main language use it in 90% of cases, any modules, smart contracts.
- **TypeScript** - follow control in clusters, DAGs, CI/CD, batch processing control.
- **Python** - use for AI, ML, DA, don't use it for system scripts.
- **C++/C** -  high performance computing (cuda,opencl),  high performance IO.
- **Bash/Sh** - use it for system scripts in containers.

### Not recommend to use next languages
- **JavaPlatform (Java, Scala, Kotlin)**  - use it only for integration with corporate and government systems don't use it
  in Converged Framework Microservices. (big footprint, not effective usage system resources, not usefully for microservices)
- **Any other exotic languages** - closure, lisp, etc. (small community)
- **Any stupid languages** - PHP, Ruby, etc. (not effective, not secure, not fast)
